# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
There has seem to be some evidence of academic dishonesty in Thomas High School. So, we were told to replace Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math scores to NaNs to see if these changes made affected the overall analysis.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
  - After changing Thomas High School's 9th grade scores to nan, there was not a large impact in the indvidual reading and math average score and overall pass rate (less than 0.35%), however, there were only 1.2% of the total population, so the change should be considered.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - It did not change as much. After removin their scores, we would have still had the same a close mean between the original and the changed. IT also doesn't affect the school ranking by a lot becuase they were not part of the top 10 or bottom 5 schools.
